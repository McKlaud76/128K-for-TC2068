If you are interested in hardware's tests and how it works, have a look there: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/7duh5zHNvDc)

The IF has been successfully tested with TC2048. In this case, RGB output does not works due to a different signal's alocation on the egde connector. Also a simple modification to TC2048 internals is essential. The missing /BE signal at the TC2048 edge connector needs to be wiried with a short wire from SCLD chip direcly. Pad number 4 on the top side of the main board is not used in any ZX Spectrum machine and it is recommenced for /BE wiring.
