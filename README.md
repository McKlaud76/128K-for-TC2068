Revision: 0.2 

![3D model](/Docs/TC2068_128K_4in1_01.png)

#### Embeded and tested features:

* 2 x 32KB ROM (tested OK)
* 128 KB RAM with ZX Spectrum +2A/B & +3 paging modes (tested OK)
* control logic in CPLD (tested OK)
* AY-3-8910 sound chip controlled with ZX128K ports (tested OK)
* Kempston joystick interface (tested OK)
* RGB video outputs (tested OK)
* RESET button (tested OK)

The schematic diagram is available in the /Docs sub-folder.

The version 0.2 will be open with the schematic diagram and Gerber files available to the publiic. The CPLD impletmentation is closed and the pre-compilied file will be available only. 

Note that any other inteface with its own ROM requires additional wiring around /ROMCS lines (towards TC2068 and incomming from any other extenal interface). The wiring enables compability with interfaces like DivMMC/DivSD. Also the order of interfaces connected to TC2068 is cricital. The first device attached to the computer's edge connector must be TMX128 otherwise it will now work correctly.

### Use with TC2048

The IF has been successfully tested with TC2048. In this case, RGB output does not works due to different signal's alocations on the egde connector. Also a simple modification to TC2048 internals is essential. The missing /BE signal at the TC2048 edge connector needs to be wiried with a short wire from SCLD chip direcly. Pad number 4 on the top side of the main board is not used in any ZX Spectrum machine and it is recommenced for /BE wiring.
