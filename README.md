The version 0.2 will be open to with schematic and Gerber files available to the publiic. The CPLD impletmentation is closed and the complie file will be available only. 

Note that any other inteface with its own ROM requires additional wiring around /ROMCS lines (towards TC2068 and incomming from any other extenal interface). The wiring enables compability with interfaces like DivMMC/DivSD however they require basic knowlage of electronic. Also the order of interfaces connected to TC2068 is cricital and the first device to the computer edge connector must be TMX128.

### Use with TC2048

The IF has been successfully tested with TC2048. In this case, RGB output does not works due to a different signal's alocations on the egde connector. Also a simple modification to TC2048 internals is essential. The missing /BE signal at the TC2048 edge connector needs to be wiried with a short wire from SCLD chip direcly. Pad number 4 on the top side of the main board is not used in any ZX Spectrum machine and it is recommenced for /BE wiring.
